/* Question:
Queries Quality and Percentage

Table: Queries
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| query_name  | varchar |
| result      | varchar |
| position    | int     |
| rating      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.
 

We define query quality as:
The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.
We also define poor query percentage as:
The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.
Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
Return the result table in any order.

#Solution:
select query_name, round(avg(rating/position),2) as quality, 
round(avg(if (rating <3, 1, 0))*100,2) as poor_query_percentage
from Queries
WHERE query_name is not null 
group by query_name;
